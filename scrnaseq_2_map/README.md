This subdirectory contains scripts to align reads to reference transcriptomes or reference genomes, depending on the aligner you choose to use. I have also added 2 scripts for using the STAR aligner, as well as a script for using the kallisto pseudo-aligner.

I prefer kallisto psuedo-alignment for both single cell and bulk RNA-Seq as it allows bootstrapping during the transcript assembly. It also has a nice R wrapper, in case you prefer the R environment over UNIX-based command line tools. I am currently providing bash scripts to do most initial alignment steps, but I will add an analogous, entirely R-based workflow soon.
