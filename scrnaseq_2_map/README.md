This subdirectory contains scripts to align reads to reference transcriptomes or reference genomes, depending on the aligner you choose to use. I prefer kallisto for psuedo-alignment as it allows bootstrapping and has a nice R wrapper. I am currently providing bash scripts to do most alignment steps in a unix environment, but I will add an analogous, entirely R-based workflow soon.
